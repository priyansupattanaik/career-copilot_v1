# Career Copilot

**One project. One README.** Everything you need to understand, run, and debug Career Copilot lives in this file.

---

## What this project is (in plain language)

Career Copilot is a **career prep web app** for people who want honest help with resumes, job applications, and interview practice.

It helps you:

1. **Build a real profile** (name, skills, experience, education, preferences, links).
2. **Upload a resume and a job description**, then get an **ATS-style keyword score** that is calculated with simple rules (not a magic “AI hiring score”).
3. **Edit that same resume** to add missing keywords only when they are true for you, with optional AI rewrite suggestions that must stick to your real text.
4. **Practice mock interviews** with generated questions.
5. **Track learning paths and saved jobs** from data stored in your account.

### The golden rule

> **The app should not invent your career.**  
> It only works from what you type, upload, confirm, or explicitly accept.  
> Your browser’s local storage is **not** the source of truth — **local SQLite (database + files + login)** is.

## 1. How the system works (big picture)

Think of three layers:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU (browser)                                              │
│  Next.js website — forms, pages, toast, PDF preview         │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                            │  Login session (JWT) + HTTPS API calls
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FASTAPI BACKEND  (/api/v1)                                 │
│  Checks your login, talks to database, runs scoring & AI    │
└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
          ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
          ▼                 ▼                 ▼
   Local JWT authentication     SQLite + RLS    Private Storage
   (who you are)     (your rows only)    (PDF, avatar, …)
                            │
                            ▼ (optional)
                   NVIDIA / Groq AI APIs
                   (server-side keys only)
```

### What happens when you click something

1. The website checks you are signed in (Local JWT authentication in the browser).
2. It calls the backend with your **access token** (`Authorization: Bearer …`).
3. The backend trusts that token, then talks to local SQLite **as you** (so row-level security applies).
4. Results come back as JSON; the UI shows them.
5. AI keys never ship to the browser — only the backend can call NVIDIA or Groq.

---

## 2. What you can do in the product

| Area | What it means for you |
|------|------------------------|
| **Sign up / sign in** | Email/password (and auth callback routes for email links). Password field supports hold-to-reveal. |
| **Onboarding** | Short first-run path so your name and basics are not blank. |
| **Dashboard** | Snapshot of resumes, ATS runs, interviews, saved jobs, recent activity, and profile completion. |
| **Profile & settings** | Edit personal info, skills, experience, education, links, preferences; upload avatar (max 3 MB); privacy; delete account. |
| **Profile completion toast** | Corner reminder listing **only what is still missing**, with accurate % from the server. |
| **Resume library** | Upload PDF/DOCX, review extracted sections, confirm, preview PDF **in a modal**, set active resume. |
| **Job descriptions** | Paste text or upload a JD file, review, confirm. |
| **ATS analysis** | Score how many JD keywords appear in your resume; list missing keywords; short improvement note. |
| **Resume edit after ATS** | Edit the **same** resume (not a fake empty copy). Add missing keywords only if you confirm. Optional AI rewrites. Export PDF/DOCX. Re-score. |
| **Mock interview** | Create a session, get questions, answer, finish or delete. |
| **Learning & jobs** | Browse/save from data stored in the database (not invented in the browser). |

---

## 3. Tech stack (what each piece is for)

### Frontend (the website)

| Tool | Why it is here |
|------|----------------|
| **Next.js (App Router)** | Pages, layouts, routing |
| **React + TypeScript** | UI components with types |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling |
| **Lucide** | Icons |
| **Motion** | Light animations |
| **Three.js / React Three Fiber** | Marketing landing globe |
| **Local auth client** | Browser and server auth sessions |

### Backend (the API)

| Tool | Why it is here |
|------|----------------|
| **Python 3.11–3.13** (prefer **3.12**) | Runtime. **3.14+ is not supported** by this package / official CrewAI. |
| **FastAPI + Uvicorn** | HTTP API server |
| **Pydantic / pydantic-settings** | Request bodies + reading `.env` |
| **httpx** | Calling NVIDIA / Groq |
| **Python sqlite3 driver** | Database + storage with your JWT |
| **pypdf / python-docx / reportlab** | Read resumes, write DOCX/PDF exports |
| **Docling** (optional) | Heavier, layout-aware PDF text if you install it |
| **crewai** (optional) | Official multi-agent package on supported Python |

### Data platform

| Tool | Why it is here |
|------|----------------|
| **Local JWT authentication** | Sign-up, sign-in, JWT |
| **SQLite** | All durable app data |
| **Local filesystem storage** | Private files (resumes, avatars, interview media, exports) |
| **SQL migrations** | Schema, security policies, buckets |

### AI providers

| Provider | Used for | Not used for |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **NVIDIA** | Resume rewrite suggestions, smarter profile fill, preferred ATS brief | Interview questions |
| **Groq** | Interview questions; ATS brief if NVIDIA is off | Resume improve “fallback” |

If an AI key is missing, the product still works with **rules/templates** where designed (for example: template interview questions, rule-based ATS brief, deterministic profile extract).

## 5. Backend deep dive (API layer)

### What the backend is

A **FastAPI** app whose job is:

- Check your login token.
- Read/write **only your rows** in local SQLite.
- Run deterministic scoring and parsing.
- Call AI when keys are set and the feature needs it.
- Return clean JSON errors (`ApiError`) instead of leaking stack traces to the client.

Entry point: `backend/app/main.py`  
Routes live mainly in `backend/app/routes.py` and `backend/app/resume_improvement_routes.py`.  
Public API prefix: **`/api/v1`**.

### Important backend modules (simple meanings)

| File / folder | What it does |
|---------------|--------------|
| `config.py` | Loads the **root** `.env` and exposes settings (local SQLite, NVIDIA, Groq, buckets, limits). |
| `auth.py` | Turns the Bearer token into a `CurrentUser` (id, email, name metadata). |
| `database.py` | Builds a **user client** (publishable key + your JWT) or an **admin client** (secret key) for rare ops like health/purge. |
| `repository.py` | “Owned rows” helpers, activity feed write/prune, **profile completion recalculation**. |
| `profile_completion.py` | Pure scoring math: checklist items → percentage + missing list. |
| `routes.py` | Most HTTP endpoints (profile, resumes, JD, ATS, interviews, jobs, settings, bootstrap). |
| `resume_improvement_routes.py` | AI improve + apply routes. |
| `ats.py` | Keyword coverage score (no LLM). |
| `parsing/` | Pull text from PDF/DOCX; split into sections. |
| `documents.py` / validation helpers | File size/type checks. |
| `resume_improvements.py` | In-place edit apply, AI suggestion pipeline, evidence checks. |
| `resume_exports.py` | Build PDF/DOCX and signed download URLs. |
| `avatars.py` | Avatar size/type checks + signed URLs. |
| `account_deletion.py` | Wipe user data when they delete their account. |
| `agents/` | All product AI: registry, NVIDIA/Groq clients, prompts, crew orchestrator. |
| `schemas.py` | Request/response shapes. |

### How a typical protected request is handled

1. Middleware assigns a **request id** and security headers.
2. Route dependency `get_current_user` validates JWT.
3. `client_for(settings, user)` opens local SQLite as that user.
4. Handlers query with `.eq("user_id", user.id)` (and RLS still applies).
5. Side effects (activity row, completion recalculation) run when needed.
6. Response is JSON; errors use a stable code + human message.

### Database connectivity (how it is done)

- **Normal app traffic:** user JWT -> FastAPI -> SQLite and local file storage.
- Account deletion uses the same ownership-checked SQLite and filesystem boundary.
- FastAPI opens the local SQLite file for each short-lived operation and enables foreign keys.
- Schema lives in `db/schema.sql` and is applied automatically.

### Optional backend extras

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[docling]"   # better PDF layout extraction
pip install -e ".[crewai]"    # official CrewAI package (Python < 3.14 only)
```

Without those extras, the app still runs: basic PDF/DOCX parsers and a **built-in CrewAI-compatible** sequential orchestrator for resume improve.

### Compatibility shims

Older import paths like `app.nvidia_client` still re-export the newer agent modules so nothing breaks during refactors.

---

## 6. Frontend deep dive (UI layer)

### How the UI is organized

| Area | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/app/` | Next.js routes and layouts (URL → page). |
| `src/features/` | Real product screens (dashboard, resume flow, interview, settings, …). |
| `src/components/` | Shared chrome: workspace shell, toast, buttons/cards. |
| `src/lib/api/client.ts` | Attaches your local SQLite session token to every API call. |
| `src/lib/auth/` | Browser/server local SQLite clients. |
| `src/lib/profile-completion.ts` | Shared helpers for % / missing items + “profile updated” browser event. |

### Workspace shell

`src/components/layout/workspace-shell.tsx`:

- Loads **`GET /me/bootstrap`** once when you enter the signed-in area.
- Shows sidebar, active resume label, avatar menu, theme toggle.
- Hosts the **profile completion toast**.
- Refreshes completion when:
  - the custom event `career-copilot:profile-updated` fires (after you save profile pieces), or
  - you leave Settings (so the score is fresh).

### API client behavior

`apiRequest` points at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` + `/api/v1`, sends the JWT, and surfaces backend error messages in the UI.

---

## 7. How login and security work

### Login flow (simple)

1. You sign up or sign in on the website (Local JWT authentication).
2. local SQLite stores a session (access + refresh tokens) using its SSR/browser helpers.
3. Every API call includes the **access token**.
4. Backend verifies the token and loads your user id.
5. All tables are filtered by `user_id` and protected by **RLS policies**.

### Security principles (how it is done)

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| No service secrets in the browser | Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are client-visible. |
| User-scoped data | Queries always owned by `user.id`; storage paths under your auth id. |
| Private files | Storage buckets are private; downloads use short-lived signed URLs. |
| AI on the server | NVIDIA/Groq keys only in root `.env`, read by FastAPI. |
| Honest AI | Validators drop invented employers, fake metrics, contact changes, etc. |
| Account deletion | Server removes owned rows and known storage objects. |
| Secret hygiene | `.env` is gitignored; `npm run check:secrets` scans for leaks. |

---

## 8. How profile completion works

### Why it exists

So you always know **how full your profile is**, and what is still empty — without guessing and without tying completion to uploading a resume.

### Source of truth

- Math: `backend/app/profile_completion.py`
- Save to DB: `repository.recalculate_completion`
- Shown in UI from server fields: `profile_completion` + `profile_completion_details.missing`

### What counts (and what does not)

- **Counts:** profile text fields, preferences lists, skills, experience **or** fresher (0 years), education, links.
- **Does not count:** uploading or confirming a resume. You can hit **100% without any resume**.

### Exact checklist (sums to 100)

| Item | Points | Complete when… |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Full name | 10 | Name is non-empty |
| Location | 8 | Location is non-empty |
| Current role | 10 | Current role is non-empty |
| Target roles | 8 | At least one target role in preferences |
| Work experience | 22 | At least one experience row **or** years of experience set to **0** (fresher) |
| Skills | 17 | At least one skill row |
| Education | 10 | At least one education row |
| Preferred work modes | 5 | At least one work mode |
| Preferred job locations | 5 | At least one preferred location |
| Professional link | 5 | At least one link (LinkedIn, GitHub, …) |

### When the score recalculates

Examples (not exhaustive): opening bootstrap, loading/saving profile, changing preferences, adding/editing/deleting skills/experience/education/links, applying profile-from-resume, deleting a resume (other data may still drive the score).

Each recalculation:

1. Reads live rows from the database.
2. Scores the checklist.
3. Writes `profiles.profile_completion` (0–100) and `profile_completion_details` (including `missing` and `completed` lists with labels and points).

### Toast and live sync (how the UI stays accurate)

1. Bootstrap returns `workspace.profile_completion` and `workspace.profile_missing`.
2. Corner toast (`profile-completion-toast.tsx`) shows:  
   **“Please complete your profile”** + % + remaining items (with `+N%` points).
3. After you save profile data, Settings calls `notifyProfileUpdated(...)`.
4. Shell and dashboard listen for that event and refresh from the server.
5. You can dismiss the toast for the current session; it returns if the % changes.

The client **filters out** any old stale `"resume"` missing item so retired rules never reappear in the UI.

---

## 9. How resume upload and parsing work

### Step by step

1. You upload a PDF or DOCX (size/type validated).
2. File is stored in the private **candidate-documents** bucket under your user id.
3. Backend extracts **plain text** (`pypdf` / `python-docx`, or Docling if installed).
4. Text is split into **sections** (summary, skills, experience, projects, education, …). Anything unclear goes to `unclassified_blocks`.
5. A **resume version** is saved with `extraction_status` not yet confirmed.
6. You **review** in the UI and **confirm** when the extract looks right.
7. Only confirmed versions are used for ATS scoring and improvement runs that require confirmation.

### PDF preview (how it is done)

- From the resume library, **Preview** opens a **modal** (not a new tab).
- Prefer the original PDF when it is still valid.
- After structural edits or DOCX sources, preview uses a rendered/exported PDF of the current structured content.

### Job descriptions

Same idea: paste or upload → extract → review → confirm. ATS needs a confirmed JD + confirmed resume version.

---

## 10. How ATS scoring works

### What it is

A **keyword coverage percentage**:

> Of the important words taken from the job description, how many appear in your resume text?

It is **not** a prediction of whether you will get hired, and it does **not** use embeddings or “semantic fit.”

### Algorithm name

`deterministic-keyword-coverage-v1` in `backend/app/ats.py`.

### Formula (simple)

```text
overall_score = round( matched_keywords / total_scored_keywords * 100 , 2 )
```

Each keyword contributes equally.

### How keywords are chosen from the JD

1. Break text into tokens (letters/numbers/tech symbols).
2. Lowercase.
3. Drop common filler words (“experience”, “required”, …).
4. Keep short tech tokens on an allowlist (`ai`, `ml`, `ui`, …) plus longer tokens.
5. Keep the top **50** unique keywords by importance (frequency + first appearance).

### Match rule

A JD keyword counts as matched only if that **exact normalized token** appears in the resume token set.

### What the report shows

- Overall score.
- Missing keywords (actionable).
- An “overall inference” paragraph (AI if available, otherwise a plain rule-based note about missing terms).
- It does **not** invent fake “evidence snippets” of things that are not in your resume.

### What does **not** change the score

- How good the AI paragraph is  
- Profile completion %  
- Soft personality narratives  
- Years of experience as a separate weighted model  

---

## 11. How in-place resume edit and AI improve work

### Goal

After an ATS report, help you improve **the resume you already have** — not create an empty second resume that looks “new.”

### Manual edit path

1. Open `/resume-analysis/report/[reportId]/edit`.
2. UI loads the **same** resume version used in that analysis.
3. Left: section forms. Right: live paper preview of real content only.
4. Missing keywords appear as chips; adding one to Skills happens **only if you click**.
5. Save calls manual-edit with `apply_mode: "in_place"` → updates the **same** `resume_versions` row.

### AI improve path (how it is done)

1. You request improvements from the confirmed resume + ATS context.
2. A **crew-style sequence** runs:
   - **Gap analyst** — reads missing keywords already scored (no invention).
   - **Improver** — NVIDIA suggests rewrites of **existing** blocks only.
   - **Validator** — drops unsupported numbers, new employers, contact changes, etc.
3. You accept / edit / reject suggestions.
4. Apply also defaults to **in place** on the same resume version.
5. You can export PDF/DOCX and re-run ATS on that version.

### Optional new version

`apply_mode: "new_version"` can create a history snapshot if you opt in. Default product path is **in place**.

### Inspiration

The UX pattern (score → keywords → edit → optional AI → export → re-check) is inspired by tools like Resume-Matcher, but this codebase is **project-native** (not a clone of that monorepo).

---

## 12. How profile fill from resume works

1. Pick a stored resume version or upload a file for preview.
2. Backend always runs a **deterministic** extract (rules from text/sections).
3. If NVIDIA is configured, an AI extract is merged carefully with the rules path.
4. You get a **draft** to review (nothing is auto-saved into your profile yet).
5. You choose what is true and **apply**.
6. Only selected fields/rows are written; completion % is recalculated.

Empty-only modes can avoid overwriting fields you already filled.

---

## 13. How mock interviews work

1. Create an interview session (role/mode/settings in the UI).
2. **Start** generates questions:
   - Prefer **Groq** with prompt `interview_questions_v1.txt`.
   - If Groq fails or is not configured → **local templates**.
   - **NVIDIA is never used** for interview questions.
3. You answer questions in the session UI.
4. Complete the session or delete it (cleanup of related rows/media as implemented).
5. Interview “evaluation AI” is **not** a shipped product capability (capability flag stays false).

---

## 14. How AI agents are organized

### Registry (single inventory)

`backend/app/agents/registry.py` lists every product agent, provider, prompt file, readiness, and fallback.

Status endpoint: **`GET /api/v1/agents/status`** (no secrets returned).

### Product agents

| Agent id | Human name | Provider | What it does | Fallback if AI off |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| `resume_improvement` | Resume improvement | NVIDIA | Suggest rewrites of real resume blocks | Manual edit + export |
| `resume_improvement_crew` | Resume improve crew | NVIDIA + crew orchestration | Gap → improve → validate sequence | Built-in sequential orchestrator always available |
| `profile_fill` | Profile fill | NVIDIA + rules | Extract profile fields from resume | Rules-only extract |
| `interview_questions` | Interview questions | **Groq only** | Generate practice questions | Templates |
| `ats_improvement_brief` | ATS brief | NVIDIA, else Groq, else rules | Explain missing keywords only | Deterministic paragraph |

### Prompts

Versioned text files under `backend/app/agents/prompts/`, for example:

- `improve_resume_v1.txt`
- `fill_profile_from_resume_v1.txt`
- `interview_questions_v1.txt`
- `ats_improvement_v1.txt`
- `repair_structured_output_v1.txt` (helper: fix broken JSON from models — not a product feature)

### LLM clients

- `agents/llm/nvidia_client.py` — chat + structured JSON + repair pass  
- `agents/llm/groq_client.py` — structured JSON + repair pass  
- `agents/llm/common.py` — strip markdown fences, extract content safely  

### Crew runtime (resume improve)

Folder: `backend/app/agents/crew/`

- If official `crewai` is installed on Python &lt; 3.14, it can be used.
- Otherwise a **compatible sequential orchestrator** runs the same three roles with the same truth-bound tools.
- Tools never invent free-form career fiction.

### Truth rules for every agent

- Do not invent employers, titles, metrics, skills, degrees, or contact info.
- Resume suggestions must be grounded in evidence blocks.
- ATS brief talks only about **missing keywords** provided by the scorer.
- User must click to add a skill chip.
- Profile AI is always previewed before save.

## 18. Environment variables

All config is expected in the **repository root** `.env` (not committed).  
Backend reads that file by absolute path from `backend/app/config.py`.

### Frontend (safe to expose to the browser)

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | API origin, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |

### Backend app

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `APP_NAME`, `APP_ENV`, `API_V1_PREFIX`, `LOG_LEVEL` | Service metadata |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` | CORS list (comma-separated), e.g. `http://localhost:3000` |

### Database and authentication (server-only)

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_PATH` | SQLite connection string, e.g. `sqlite://sqlite@127.0.0.1:5432/career-copilot` |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Secret used to sign local login sessions |
| `LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` | Filesystem directory for uploaded documents and media |
### Storage

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `DOCUMENT_BUCKET`, `AVATAR_BUCKET`, `INTERVIEW_BUCKET` | Bucket names |
| `DOCUMENT_MAX_BYTES`, `AVATAR_MAX_BYTES`, `INTERVIEW_MEDIA_MAX_BYTES` | Size limits |

### NVIDIA

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `NVIDIA_BASE_URL`, `NVIDIA_MODEL` | Provider setup |
| `NVIDIA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `NVIDIA_MAX_RETRIES`, `NVIDIA_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `NVIDIA_TEMPERATURE` | Call policy |
| `NVIDIA_PROMPT_VERSION` | Label for prompt versioning |
| `IMPROVEMENT_MAX_*`, `EXPORT_SIGNED_URL_SECONDS` | Safety caps / signed URL lifetime |

### Groq

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_BASE_URL`, `GROQ_MODEL` | Provider setup |
| `GROQ_*` timeouts / retries / tokens / temperature | Call policy |

**Never** put secret keys in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.

Validate names without printing secret values:

```powershell
npm run check:env
```

## 19. Setup and run (step by step)

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (for the website and npm scripts).
2. **Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13** (3.12 recommended).  
   Python **3.14+ will not work** with this package’s pin (`>=3.11,<3.14`).
3. A No database server is required. The application creates `.data/career-copilot.sqlite` and applies `db/schema.sql` automatically.
4. Optional: NVIDIA API key, Groq API key.

### 1) Create root `.env`

Copy your real keys into `.env` at the project root (see [§18](#18-environment-variables)).

### 2) Install everything

```powershell
npm install
```

What this does:

- Installs frontend packages.
- Runs `scripts/setup-backend.mjs`, which:
  - finds a supported Python (prefers 3.12),
  - creates `backend/.venv`,
  - installs the FastAPI package (and CrewAI when possible).

If your machine has multiple Pythons:

```powershell
$env:CAREER_COPILOT_PYTHON = "C:\Path\To\Python312\python.exe"
$env:CAREER_COPILOT_RECREATE_VENV = "1"
npm install
```

### 3) Run the full stack

```powershell
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` first applies the idempotent local schema and runs a transactional database write/read/rollback check. The frontend and API start only when both checks pass. `npm run db:setup` runs the same database checks without starting the servers.

`npm install` installs the frontend dependencies, creates the Python environment, and installs the backend including the SQLite driver. SQLite is included with Python, so no database server or separate database installation is required.

Then open:

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Website | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://127.0.0.1:8000 |
| API docs | http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs |

Or run pieces separately:

```powershell
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend
```

### 4) Production-style frontend build

```powershell
npm run build
npm run start
```

API example:

```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## 20. Scripts and day-to-day commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|----------------|
| `npm install` | Frontend deps + backend venv setup |
| `npm run dev` | API + Next together |
| `npm run db:setup` | Apply the local schema and verify database write/read/rollback |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Next only |
| `npm run dev:backend` | Uvicorn only |
| `npm run build` / `start` | Production Next build/serve |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| `npm run check:env` | Env presence/consistency |
| `npm run check:secrets` | Scan for leaked secrets |
| `npm run check` | secrets + env + lint + typecheck + build |
| `npm run check:frontend` | lint + typecheck + build |

---

## 21. Debugging checklist

| Symptom | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| API not reachable | `GET /api/v1/health`; confirm `npm run dev:backend` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` |
| “Not configured / session” errors | Sign out/in; check local SQLite URL/keys; `GET /api/v1/health/database` |
| Agents “not ready” | `GET /api/v1/agents/status`; set NVIDIA/Groq keys if you need AI paths |
| Profile % wrong / toast wrong | Save profile once (forces recalculate); hard refresh; check bootstrap `workspace.profile_missing` |
| ATS score 0 / unexpected | Confirm **both** resume version and JD are **confirmed**; score is exact keyword match only |
| Resume “created a new empty resume” | Use post-ATS **edit** flow with `in_place` (default); do not start a blank resume for that path |
| Python / venv issues | Use 3.11–3.13; set `CAREER_COPILOT_PYTHON`; recreate venv |
| CORS errors | Set `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` to include `http://localhost:3000` |

Logs: Uvicorn access logs + request id middleware help correlate a UI error with a server request.

## 22. What this project deliberately does not do

| Not a goal | Why / reality |
|------------|----------------|
| Clone Resume-Matcher’s full monorepo | We reimplemented the useful flow, not the whole product surface |
| Semantic / embedding ATS | Score is exact keyword coverage by design |
| AI interview grading | Questions yes; evaluation agent is off |
| AI job recommender as core product | Tables/UI may exist; capability is not claimed as live AI |
| Give profile points for uploading a resume | Completion is **profile fields only** |
| Store truth only in localStorage | Database is system of record |
| Put AI keys in the browser | Server-only |
| Support Python 3.14 for this package | Pin is `>=3.11,<3.14` |

---

## 23. Typical user journeys

### A) First day

1. Sign up / sign in.  
2. See the profile toast if your checklist is incomplete.  
3. Open **Settings → Profile** and fill remaining items (toast % updates after save).  
4. Optional: fill profile from a resume draft (preview → apply only what is true).

### B) ATS + improve resume

1. Upload resume → review extract → confirm.  
2. Add job description → confirm.  
3. Run ATS analysis → read score + missing keywords.  
4. Open **Edit resume** → fix truthfully → save in place.  
5. Optional AI suggestions → accept only good ones → apply.  
6. Export PDF/DOCX → re-run ATS on the same version.

### C) Interview practice

1. Create mock interview.  
2. Start session (Groq or templates).  
3. Answer → complete or delete.

### D) Ongoing

1. Dashboard shows latest resume / interview / job actions.  
2. Save jobs, follow learning paths.  
3. Manage privacy or delete account under settings.

## Package identity

| Package | Version | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| `career-copilot` (npm) | 1.0.0 | Frontend + orchestration scripts |
| `career-copilot-api` (Python) | 1.0.0 | FastAPI backend under `backend/` |

Deploy with **your** local SQLite project and **your** API keys.

## Final notes

- This repository has **one README**: this file.  
- Backend structure, scoring, agents, env, and run instructions are all documented above.  
- When in doubt: **server recalculation + database rows beat any client guess.**

*Last aligned with the codebase: unified docs, profile completion without resume weight, in-place resume edit, deterministic ATS, NVIDIA/Groq agent split, Python 3.11–3.13 setup.*
